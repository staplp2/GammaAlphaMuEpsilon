## Fixed Time Step vs Variable Time Step

Fixed time waits each frame so that all frame times are >= a fixed time step.

```
dt = fixed_time_step;
wait(max(actual_frame_time, fixed_time_step));
```

Variable time scales the length of the frame based on the prior:

```
dt = now() - last_time;
last_time = now();
```
